# ClimateAction.tech: Code of Conduct

Note: In addition to our code of conduct, please also consider reviewing our [ClimateAction.tech Overview document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NoBEjzXRQs6npHVJ8n0y349OXKqjEEz74ht4LOzvYKE/edit?usp=sharing) for a deeper exploration of the community and its values.

## 1. Purpose
One of the primary goals of ClimateAction.tech is to be inclusive to the largest number of collaborators, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religious beliefs.

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

We invite all those who participate in ClimateAction.tech to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.


## 2. Tech Industry Citizenship
A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase tech industry citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.

Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.

If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know.


## 3. Expected Behavior
The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:

* We respect the privacy of people who choose to participate in our community. As a general guide, please observe the [Chatham House Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_House_Rule):
> “Participants are free to use the information received, but neither the identity nor the affiliation of the speaker(s), nor that of any other participant, may be revealed.”
* Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community. Exercise consideration and respect in speech and action.
* Attempt collaboration before conflict.
* Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert a **community moderator** if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential. (See “Reporting Guidelines” below)
* Be conscientious of where on the Slack you are holding a discussion (especially **#general** and **#news-discussion**). We would prefer to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio for everyone, so please comply if you’re asked to move a conversation.


## 4. Unacceptable Behavior
The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community:

* Surveying, canvassing, or offering promotions to community members. We take the attention of this community seriously. Please contact a Slack admin (see below) before soliciting broad input or offering discounts to members.
* Sustained disruption of community events, including talks and presentations.
* Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
* Violence, threats of violence, or violent language directed against another person.
* Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.
* Posting or threatening to post other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
* Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.
* Inappropriate photography or recording.
* Inappropriate physical contact. You should have someone's consent before touching them.
* Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes, sexualized comments or jokes; inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcomed sexual advances.
* Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person).
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.


## 5. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior
Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).


## 6. Reporting Guidelines
If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a community moderator as soon as possible on Slack:

**Community Moderators**
* Melissa Hsiung
  * Slack: @melissa
  * Email: melissa.cat2050@gmail.com

Additionally, community organizers are available to help community members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe. In the context of in-person events, organizers will also provide escorts as desired by the person experiencing distress.


## 7. Scope
We expect all community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venues — online and in-person — as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community business.

This code of conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of community activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.
